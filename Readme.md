2. You now have this repo in your GitHub account. You must be able to see it at `github.com/your-github-username/hacktoberfest-2023`. You can clone the repository.

3. Go ahead and **clone this repository** from your account to your PC. Make sure you have Git installed on your PC. Use the command `git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/hacktoberfest-2023` to clone the repository.

4. Open the cloned directory using your system's file manager. You must see a folder called **contributions**. Go inside the folder using the commmand ```cd contributions```. Inside this folder, you must create an HTML file named ```<name>.html``` where you replace ***name** with your name. Copy the HTML code shown below and paste it in the file with an **image link** which is possibly your GitHub profile picture and add your name and message in the respective places.

   ```
   <div class="card">
       <img src="your_github_profile_link" alt="Image" >
       <div>
           <p class="name">NAME : <b class="name1" style="color: #d2b863">Your_Name</b></p>
           <p class="message">MESSAGE : <b class="message1" style="color: #d2b863">My First PR</b></p>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

   - Login to your GitHub account and click on the profile icon which appears at the leftmost side of the page.
   - Then right-click on the big avatar which appears at the left side of the screen.
   - Click Copy Image Address and replace **your_github_profile_link** with the link.

5. After doing all these, save the file and close the editor.

6. Now commit your changes by following the below steps:

   - Open the terminal/command prompt inside the cloned folder.
   - Run `git add .` to stage the file for committing.
   - Let's commit! Run `git commit -m "Your commit message"`. Get creative with your commit message. You can follow the below format:
     - "[your name]: Add me as a contributor"
     - For instance: "[Hemanth]: Add me as a contributor"
   - Now let's get these changes to your GitHub repo. Run `git push origin main`.

7. You are almost done! Now head over to the original repository from which you forked and click on **Pull Requests**.
